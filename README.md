# Fix-CapsLock-Delay-in-Linux-Distros
This is a common keyboard delay problem in Linux distros. 

## Is it a bug/mistake?
Actually this predefined structure comes from early typewriters. My script configures XKB (X Keyboard Extension) file. 

Remember, if you want to permanently change, you need to set this script as a startup application.


### Usage
```sh DelayFixer.sh```
